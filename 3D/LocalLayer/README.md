###About

The LocalLayer Widget for ArcGIS Web AppBuilder is intended to allow the direct addition of ArcGIS for Server Mapservices to an 3D ArcGIS Web AppBuilder application, without needing to wrap the desired services in an ArcGIS Online/Portal Web Map.  It's currently largely a proof of concept; For general instructions on usage, please read the documentation for LocalLayer, and report on any bugs/ideas/unsupported features in the LocalLayer thread on Geonet!
